I did a little code runner/printer in 2023
You can find it in LazyRunner or 2023 folder

The idea was to be able to print the run for a day/part/mode (demo or real) easily
Being able to launch all the demo or all the real deal was a goal as well

The idea is as follow :
- arguments.py has all of the inputs for the days
- Day.py is just a day class
- init turns the arguments and other elements into Day objects
- main.py runs on Day objects list or elements to pretty print them
