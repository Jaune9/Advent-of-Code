I did a little code runner/printer in 2023
You can find it in LazyRunner or 2023 folder

The idea was to be able to print the run for a day/part/mode (demo or real) easily
Being able to launch all the demo or all the real deal was a goal as well

The idea is as follow :
- arguments.py has all of the inputs for the days
- Day.py turns the inputs and other elements into a Day object
- main.py runs on Day object list to pretty print them
